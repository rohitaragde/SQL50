low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.
use rohit;

create table Products001
(product_id int primary key,
low_fats enum('Y','N'),
recyclable enum('Y','N'));

insert into Products001 values(0,'Y','N');
insert into Products001 values(1,'Y','Y');
insert into Products001 values(2,'N','Y');
insert into Products001 values(3,'Y','Y');
insert into Products001 values(4,'N','N');

select * from Products001;

select product_id from Products001
where low_fats='Y' and recyclable='Y'
order by product_id;
